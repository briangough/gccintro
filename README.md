An Introduction to GCC - a tutorial for new users of gcc and g++

This manual provides a tutorial introduction to the GNU C and C++
compilers, gcc and g++.  Many books teach the C and C++ languages,
this book explains how to use the compiler itself.

The manual is written in TeXinfo, to generate the output use:

    $ texi2pdf gccintro.pdf

A printed edition of the book is published by Network Theory Ltd

Although the content of the manual is still mostly valid, it needs
updating for GCC version 4 and later.  As I no longer have time to
update this manual, I have uploaded it to github.
